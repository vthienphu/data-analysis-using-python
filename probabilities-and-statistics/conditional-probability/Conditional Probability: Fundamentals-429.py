## 2. Brief Recap ##

p_2 = 1/6
p_odd = 3/6
p_2_or_4 = 2/6

## 3. Updating Probabilities ##

p_3 = 1/4
p_6 = 0/4
p_odd = 2/4
p_even = 2/4

## 4. Conditional Probability ##

p_december = 1/3
p_summer = 0/3
p_ends_r = 1/3

## 5. Conditional Probability Formula ##

card_b = 21
card_a_and_b = 9
p_a_given_b = card_a_and_b / card_b

## 6. Example Walkthough ##

p_negative_given_non_hiv = 6/30
print(p_negative_given_non_hiv)

'''
The probability of testing negative given that a patient is not
infected with HIV is 20%. This means that for every 10,000 healthy
patients, only about 2000 will get a correct diagnosis, while the
other 8000 will not. It looks like the test is almost completely
inefficient, and it could be dangerous to have it used in hospitals.

## 7. Probability Formula ##

p_premium_given_chrome = 158/2762
p_basic_given_safari = 274/1288
p_free_given_firefox = 2103/2285
more_likely_premium = 'Safari' #because P(Premium | Safari) > P(Premium | Chrome)
